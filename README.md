# Web 3 Dashboard

A simple application that consumes the Moralis API to:

- fetch tokens and balances
- fetch last 10 transactions
- fetch NFTs
- Allow sending of ETH to another wallet

Overall styling and aesthetic needs work, the goal of this project was to learn more about the Moralis API and tooling. Site is only optimised for desktop currently and can be viewed [here](https://web3-dashboard-lac.vercel.app/)
